Let's say you have a scene with two objects and a sun.

## Unwrap

For each objects, add a new uv slot, and set it active.  
Select all objects, switch to *Edit mode*, press *u* and choose *Lightmap Pack*.

Uvs should not overlap.

## Configure materials

![Shader editor](./images/atlasBakingInBlender/shader.png)

In each object materials, add an *Image Texture* node, bound to a new image.

## Bake

In *Render Properties > Bake*, choose what you want to bake.  
Properly configure the *Margin* option, the size should be less than the spaces between islands in your uv map.

Also, looks like the denoiser introduce some artefacts at edges, investigation is required.

Make sure you selected all the objects, as well as the *Image Texture* node within the shader editor.

Press the bake button.
